<h1>THE TRIFORCE</h1>

<body>
"It can only be called fate... That here, I would again gather the three 
with the crests... That I should lay my hand on that which grants the wishes 
of the beholder. That when power, wisdom, and courage come together, 
the gods would have no choice but to come down... The power of the gods... 
The Triforce! He who touches it will have whatever he desires granted!" <br>
